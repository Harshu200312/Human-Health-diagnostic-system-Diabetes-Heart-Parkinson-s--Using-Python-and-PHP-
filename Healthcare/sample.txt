﻿Based on the information you have provided, it is possible that you may have type 2 diabetes. You have several symptoms that are commonly associated with this condition, including frequent urination, excessive thirst, unexplained weight loss, increased hunger and appetite, fatigue and weakness, blurred vision, tingling or numbness in the hands or feet, and frequent infections.

However, it is important to note that these symptoms can also be caused by other conditions. To confirm a diagnosis of diabetes, you would need to undergo a blood test to measure your blood sugar levels.

If you are concerned about your symptoms, it is important to see a doctor for evaluation. Early diagnosis and treatment of diabetes can help prevent or delay serious complications.

**Type 1 or Type 2 Diabetes**

The type of diabetes you may have cannot be determined based on the information you have provided. Type 1 diabetes is usually diagnosed in childhood or young adulthood, while type 2 diabetes is more common in adults over the age of 40.

**Chances of Developing Diabetes in the Future**

If you do not currently have diabetes, you may still be at risk of developing it in the future. This is especially true if you have a family history of diabetes or if you are overweight or obese.

By making healthy lifestyle choices, such as eating a healthy diet, getting regular exercise, and maintaining a healthy weight, you can help reduce your risk of developing diabetes.﻿
